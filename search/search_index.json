At the beginning, user needs to design processing pipeline in visual pipeline editor. The processing flow is from top to bottom: First, select a step you want to add from the list of available processing steps: There are three pipeline step categories: Preprocessing : such actions as marker filtering, data transformation, scaling, etc. Embeddings : dimensionality reduction via PCA, t-SNE, UMAP Clustering : community detection by Louvain or Leiden algorithms Each step has his own sets of parameters. By clicking on parameter field you can see its short description: One can change step order in a pipeline by clicking Up / Down arrow buttons or delete it: Warning Some steps require additional steps defined beforehand in the pipeline to run properly. For instance, UMAP embedding or any clustering step needs Neighborhood graph detection step defined upper in the pipeline. If you miss such steps, there will be a warning message preventing the submission to processing. As soon as pipeline is complete, you can submit it to back-end for a processing by background workers.

For more details please see https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/ImcSegmentationPipeline Before uploading dataset to histoCAT, there are some additional steps users need to do. Output of the ImcSegmentationPipeline should contain the folder called cpout (i.e. CellProfiler output). Here is an example of a content in such folders: By default, this folder misses one important piece - channel order information. The easiest way to fix it at the moment is to manually copy a single file with channel order information from another folder, which is tiffs folder with the content similar to the following: You may see there several CSV files with _ac_full.csv suffix. Just copy one of these files into cpout folder. This file will be used by histoCAT to find out about channel order information when you upload dataset. In order to upload the dataset, please create a ZIP archive of the before-mentioned cpout folder (with included _ac_full.csv file) and then upload it to histoCAT. ImcSegmentationPipelineV2 ImcSegmentationPipeline v2 has some changes in the output format. For details, please see official changelog . Zip file content should have the following folder structure: DeepCell segmentation DeepCell is a deep learning library for single-cell analysis of biological images. Pre-trained DeepCell Mesmer model used for cell/nuclei segmentation from raw image data. Note Super-admin users can upload new models in addition to a default DeepCell Mesmer model. Automatic DeepCell segmentation in histoCAT Web will create grayscale cell/nuclear masks of the same x and y dimensions as the original images, containing unique pixel values for each cell/nucleus. Mean cell intensities and cell centroid coordinates measured as well. Note Depending on the application, DeepCell requires images of specific dimensions. For example, in the case of cell segmentation using Mesmer, DeepCell expects two-channel images as input, where the first channel must be a nuclear channel (e.g., DAPI) and the second channel must be a membrane or cytoplasmic channel (e.g., E-Cadherin). To run DeepCell segmentation, please follow these steps: Switch to Segmentation panel in Project workspace. Select acquisitions which should be analysed in order to acquire their segmentation masks and to measure cell-specific data. Channels panel will be populated with metal channels of the selected acquisitions. Select channels of two types: nuclear and cytoplasm channels. If multiple channels of the same type selected, they will be merged into a two-channel image, compatible with DeepCell Mesmer input format. Channels that do have type None are excluded from segmentation. In GENERAL tab at the right part of the Segmentation panel select a model, type of segmentation (whole-cell or nuclear), and give a proper name and description for dataset that will be generated. Adjust DeepCell pre- and post- processing settings if needed (these settings located in PRE and POST tabs). For details see DeepCell settings When ready, click SUBMIT button to start segmentation processing on the server side.

For example, in the case of cell segmentation using Mesmer, DeepCell expects two-channel images as input, where the first channel must be a nuclear channel (e.g., DAPI) and the second channel must be a membrane or cytoplasmic channel (e.g., E-Cadherin). To run DeepCell segmentation, please follow these steps: Switch to Segmentation panel in Project workspace. Select acquisitions which should be analysed in order to acquire their segmentation masks and to measure cell-specific data. Channels panel will be populated with metal channels of the selected acquisitions. Select channels of two types: nuclear and cytoplasm channels. If multiple channels of the same type selected, they will be merged into a two-channel image, compatible with DeepCell Mesmer input format. Channels that do have type None are excluded from segmentation. In GENERAL tab at the right part of the Segmentation panel select a model, type of segmentation (whole-cell or nuclear), and give a proper name and description for dataset that will be generated. Adjust DeepCell pre- and post- processing settings if needed (these settings located in PRE and POST tabs). For details see DeepCell settings When ready, click SUBMIT button to start segmentation processing on the server side.","title":"DeepCell segmentation"},{"location":"user/datasets/#pre-processing-settings","text":"Channel-wise image normalization If Min-Max or Z-score per-channel normalization enabled in PRE tab, channels intensities are scaled for each channel independently before merging them into two-channel input image.","title":"Pre-processing settings"},{"location":"user/datasets/#post-processing-settings","text":"","title":"Post-processing settings"},{"location":"user/groups/","text":"Groups Groups allow users to combine relevant projects together and share content among group members.

Briefly, users first import raw imaging data and visualize multiplexed images in the viewer. Second, they may apply segmentation masks and make single-cell measurements (i.e. per-channel mean ion counts, centroid coordinates). Finally, users can analyse single-cell data via customizable processing pipelines. Raw image data in the proprietary Fluidigm MCD format is converted into OME-TIFF file format upon uploading to the histoCAT Web server. Single or multiple metal channels can be shown in the WebGL-accelerated image viewer (Fig. 1a), with corresponding intensity histograms, and image intensity ranges and colors can be adjusted per channel. Gaussian or mean image filters can be applied to smooth noisy images. Combinations of these project settings can be saved as presets for later use and shared among group users for reproducible visualization. Slides Slides view represents all uploaded slides in a tree-structured manner, Where each slide can host multiple image acquisitions and panorama images. The first step is to upload compatible slides files. Three formats supported at the moment: MCD\u2122 files acquired with the Hyperion\u2122 Imaging System and CyTOF\u00ae Software 6.7 and later. Such files have *.mcd extension. You can also upload zipped MCD files in order to decrease upload size. Zipped output of mcdfolder2imcfolder conversion of imctools v2 library.

To do so please click Delete button in the Slides view: Channels As soon as an acquisition is selected in the workspace view, the channel list will be populated. The channel list displays all channels acquired for the selected acquisitions. Select one or more channels from the list to show relevant layers in Image panel. You can sort rows in the channel table, search for specific entries or change custom labels by clicking on it: Info Channel labels changes are global, i.e. visible to all users as they are stored in the database, not locally.
